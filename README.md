## Overview ðŸŒŸ

**StellarRent** is a decentralized platform built on the Stellar blockchain, designed to facilitate peer-to-peer (P2P) rentals between property owners and tenants. By eliminating intermediaries such as real estate agencies or centralized platforms (e.g., Airbnb), StellarRent offers a cost-efficient, transparent, and secure rental experience.

Leveraging Stellarâ€™s capabilities, including fast transactions (3-5 seconds), minimal fees (~$0.00001), and smart contracts powered by Soroban, StellarRent provides an innovative solution for both short- and long-term rentals.

### Key Features ðŸ”‘
- **P2P Marketplace**: Property owners list properties (houses, apartments, rooms) on a decentralized application (dApp), allowing tenants to negotiate directly.  
- **Stablecoin Payments**: Transactions use USDC on Stellar, ensuring instant and stable payments, avoiding crypto volatility.  
- **Escrow via Smart Contracts**: Payments are locked in a Soroban smart contract until predefined conditions are met (e.g., tenant confirms the propertyâ€™s condition at the end of the rental period).  
- **Transparency**: All transactions are recorded on Stellarâ€™s public ledger.  
- **Reputation System**: User ratings based on past rental history enhance trust within the platform.  
- **Low Costs**: Avoids high fees from traditional platforms (e.g., Airbnb charges up to 14.2% per booking).

### Problems Solved ðŸš©
- High intermediary costs (real estate agencies, rental platforms).  
- Slow or insecure payments.  
- Lack of transparency in rental agreements.  
- Exclusion of small property owners/tenants from emerging markets.

## Why StellarRent? ðŸ¤”

Traditional rental platforms and agencies charge high fees, impose lengthy processing times, and often lack transparency. StellarRent addresses these challenges by leveraging blockchain technology to create an open, efficient, and fair rental marketplace.

StellarRent utilizes smart contracts on the Stellar blockchain to:  
- **List properties** as an owner  
- **Rent properties** as a tenant  
- **Confirm rentals** as an owner  
- **Make secure payments** using blockchain technology
